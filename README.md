InferencePGM
============

This project aims to reproduce results in paper "A Comparison of Algorithms for Inference and Learning in Probabilistic Graphical Models" by Brendan J. Frey

Algorithms:
  * ICM (DONE)
  * Exact EM (WIP)
  * Gibbs Sampling EM (TODO)
  * Variational EM (TODO)
  * Belief Propogation (TODO)
